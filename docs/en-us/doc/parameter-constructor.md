Parameter constructor
---

No matter how intricate the parameter structure required by the method under test is, even there is no suitable construction method, or even there are private internal class objects... Call `TestableMock`, the parameter object will be handed to you immediately~

This feature is planned to be released in the `0.5.x` version.
